# Audio-Equalizer-using-MATLAB
## Overview

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing an Audio Equalizer. An audio equalizer is a digital signal processing tool that allows users to adjust the balance between different frequency components in an audio signal.

## Features

- **Graphic Equalizer:** MATLAB implementation of a graphic equalizer with adjustable frequency bands.
- **Real-time Processing:** Code for real-time audio processing to dynamically adjust the equalizer settings.
- **Visualization:** Plotting of the frequency response and equalizer settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (R2018a or later recommended)

### Usage

1. **Run the Equalizer:**
   - Open `equalizer_1.m` in MATLAB.
   - Modify the audio input source if needed.
   - Run the script.

2. **Adjust Equalizer Settings:**
   - Use the provided graphical user interface (GUI) to adjust frequency bands and gain.
